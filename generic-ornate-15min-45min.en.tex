	%\begin{block}{Copnclusions on elevation and time}
		%\begin{itemize}
			%\item elevation was not chosen through the step-wise process
			%\begin{itemize}	
				%\item elevation not as important as other variables
				%\item elevation classes already classify elevation
				%\item elevation classes may be to small for elevation to be important
			%\end{itemize}
			%\item Time may not explain enough variance to use regression for time trends
			%\item agree with the biotics effects report that pH is increasing over time
			%\item sulfate has more decreasing trends for set 3 than any other time set
		%\end{itemize}
	%\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Conclusions on Sulfate}
		sulfate desorption is of greater concern than pH levels in the park
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Lack of trend found in the Biotics effects report were attributed to high elevation soil adsorption of depsotional sulfate
				%sulfate pollution is held between deposition and the streams
			\item Sulfate will remain absorbed to soil particles as long as soil water chemistry remains high in sulfate concentration and low in pH
				%when pH rises and sulfate concentration lowers the extra "held" sulfate pollution will make its way into the streams
			%\item sulfate elevation trends are decreasing overtime but mean concentrations are increasing through time
			\item Over time most sulfate concentrations are positive but in set 3: classes 1, 4, and 6 have negative trends
			\item The elevation trend is decreasing over time
			\item The combination of these trends support desorption of sulfate into the streams bringing the elevation trend to equilibrium
