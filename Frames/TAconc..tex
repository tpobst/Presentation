	%\begin{block}{Copnclusions on elevation and time}
		%\begin{itemize}
			%\item elevation was not chosen through the step-wise process
			%\begin{itemize}	
				%\item elevation not as important as other variables
				%\item elevation classes already classify elevation
				%\item elevation classes may be to small for elevation to be important
			%\end{itemize}
			%\item Time may not explain enough variance to use regression for time trends
			%\item agree with the biotics effects report that pH is increasing over time
			%\item sulfate has more decreasing trends for set 3 than any other time set
		%\end{itemize}

		Sulfate desorption is of greater concern than pH levels in the park
		\begin{itemize}
			%\item Lack of trend found in the Biotics effects report were attributed to high elevation soil adsorption of depsotional sulfate
				%sulfate pollution is held between deposition and the streams
			%\item Sulfate will remain absorbed to soil particles as long as soil water chemistry remains high in sulfate concentration and low in pH
				%when pH rises and sulfate concentration lowers the extra "held" sulfate pollution will make its way into the streams
			%\item sulfate elevation trends are decreasing overtime but mean concentrations are increasing through time
			\uncover<1-6>{\item Over time most sulfate trends are \alert{positive} but in set 3: classes 1, 4, and 6 have \textcolor{blue}{negative} trends (-0.052, -0.068, -0.059)}
			%\item Sulfate trends are all negative but insignificant in the time variable based trends
			\uncover<3-6>{\item The elevation trend is decreasing over the three time sets (37.371, 35.793, 29.715)}
			\uncover<5,6>{\item pH is \textcolor{blue}{increasing} while the sulfate trends are \textcolor{blue}{decreasing}}
			\uncover<6>{\item This combination could lead to sulfate desorption}
