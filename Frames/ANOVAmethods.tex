				\begin{itemize}
					\item The three time sets will be tested against each other for sameness
					\item With more than 2 groups ANOVA cannot say which groups are the same or not the same
					\item The Bonferroni method can achieve this
					\begin{itemize}
						\item It will compare all time sets with each other in pairs (1:2, 1:3, 2:3)
						\item SPSS multiplies the p-value of the least significant differences (LSD) by the number of tests
						\item Insignificant comparisons are considered statistically equal
