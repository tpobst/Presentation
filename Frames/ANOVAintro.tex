				Is there a correlation between the decrease in Noland Divide TF sulfate concentrations and the decrease of sulfur dioxide emissions from Kingston and Bull run power plant emissions due to the installation of scrubbers in 2008?

			\only<2>{\begin{block}{}
				If there is a correlation between the decrease of sulfate concentrations and lowered sulfur dioxide emissions,\\ then time sets 2 and 3 will not be statistically equal.
